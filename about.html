    <div class="about-content">
        <p>
            I'm a wildlife photographer based in [Location], with a passion for capturing
            the beauty and behavior of the natural world. What started as a hobby just over
            a year ago has evolved into a deeply rewarding journey of discovery and creative
            expression.
        </p>

        <p>
            My work primarily focuses on birds and smaller wildlife subjects &mdash; the intimate
            moments and intricate details that often go unnoticed. From the iridescent
            feathers of a hummingbird to the delicate patterns on an insect's wings, I'm
            drawn to subjects that reveal the remarkable complexity of nature when we take
            the time to look closely.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm constantly learning and growing as a photographer, exploring new techniques
            and pushing myself to capture images that not only document wildlife but also
            convey the wonder and connection I feel when I'm out in the field. Each outing
            is an opportunity to observe, learn, and hopefully bring back images that
            inspire others to appreciate the natural world.
        </p>

        <p>
            This website serves as my evolving portfolio &mdash; a living collection that grows
            alongside my skills and experiences. I'm excited about what lies ahead,
            including an upcoming trip to Africa where I'll be photographing larger
            wildlife for the first time.
